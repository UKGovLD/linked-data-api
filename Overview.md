# Introduction #

This project is looking at how to make linked data accessible via APIs that are readily usable by developers who really don't want to learn about RDF or SPARQL.

It stems from a discussion [thread](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-lod/2009Dec/0101.html) initiated by Jeni Tennison.
