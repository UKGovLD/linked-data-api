[Linked data](http://linkeddata.org/) offers a set of best practices for publishing, sharing and linking data and information on the web. It is based on use of http URIs and semantic web standards such as [RDF](http://www.w3.org/RDF/).

For some web developers the need to understand the RDF data model and associated serializations and query language ([SPARQL](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/)) has proved a barrier to adoption of linked data. This project seeks to develop APIs, data formats and supporting tools to overcome this barrier. Including, but not limited to, accessing linked data via a developer-friendly JSON format.
