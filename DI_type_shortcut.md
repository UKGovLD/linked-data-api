## rdf:type shortcut ##

Do we want a shortcut for denoting the rdf:type of an object? Such as "a" instead of the plain "type" that would result from the rules so far?

More significantly should the value of type be abbreviated in the same style as properties.

_I think the latter issue is duplicated elsewhere._
